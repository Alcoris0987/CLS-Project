INTRODUCTION

This is a GitHub page for the MA-DTA CLS Project of Cagatay and Isaac in the University of Antwerp.

CLS_graphs shows the tables we used for the paper.

Cho_Sahin_CLS_Project.docx is the paper itself.

Cho_Sahin_CLS_Project.ipynb is the main code used for the paper.

Cho_Sahin_YouTube_DataScrape.ipynb is the python code for scraping KaraFun YouTube.

karafun_top_50_with_styles.xlsx is the resulting KaraFun YouTube dataset.

karafuncatalog.csv is the KaraFun catalogue dataset officially provided by KaraFun.

spotifydata.xlsx is the Spotify data provided initially by Hamidani (2019) and modified for our usecase.

We recommend running the codes on Google Colab rather than Jupyter. We have seen issues with Jupyter with the same code that runs fine in Google Colab.
